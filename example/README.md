# Example

See `src.js` for a simple example of using ES7 `async` functions.  Building it will generate `index.js` that uses [creed coroutines](https://github.com/briancavalier/creed).

## Build it

To build src.js, which uses ES7 `async`, into index.js, which uses creed coroutines:

```
npm run build
```

## Run it

```
node ./index.js ./data
```
